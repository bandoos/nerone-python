#+title: Notes

* NEROne current evaluation scheme

Data model of the input data:

An RSS-channel-item sequence (or "united" unique item)

Containing the <emm:text> and then a sequence of sibling <> items
- ORGANIZATION
- PERSON
- LOCATION
- ??

  The value inside of this tag is "[<index-start>] <text> [<index-end>]"
  where the indices are the (monotonically increasing?) overall char positions
  of the entity in the text.

  :NOTE:
    TODO: how are ideograms managed in charsets?
  :END:


Then intrisic model is

(Text),
[(categ, start, end, text)]

To be more clean I'd prefer to keep track of the corpus id too
in a cross-dataset context

So this would mean

corpus_id -> Text

and [(corpus_id, start, end, text)]
